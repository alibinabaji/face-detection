import cv2: Imports the OpenCV library, which provides functions for computer vision tasks.

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0): Initializes video capture from the default webcam (index 0).

face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'): Loads the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. This classifier is provided by OpenCV.

face_id = 0: Initializes a variable to store the ID for each detected face. This ID will be incremented for each new face detected.

trackers = []: Initializes an empty list to store trackers for each detected face. Trackers are used for object tracking.

face_id_map = {}: Initializes an empty dictionary to store the mapping between face IDs and their corresponding bounding boxes.

while True:: Starts an infinite loop for capturing frames from the webcam and performing face detection and tracking.

ret, frame = cap.read(): Reads a frame from the webcam. ret indicates whether a frame was successfully read, and frame contains the image data.

gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY): Converts the color frame to grayscale. Face detection typically works better on grayscale images.

faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30)): Detects faces in the grayscale frame using the Haar Cascade classifier. It returns a list of rectangles (bounding boxes) where faces are detected.

for tracker in trackers:: Iterates over each tracker in the trackers list.

success, box = tracker['tracker'].update(frame): Updates the tracker with the new frame and retrieves the updated bounding box (box) for the tracked object.

if success:: Checks if the tracker update was successful.

p1 = (int(box[0]), int(box[1])): Calculates the top-left corner of the bounding box (p1).

p2 = (int(box[0] + box[2]), int(box[1] + box[3])): Calculates the bottom-right corner of the bounding box (p2).

cv2.rectangle(frame, p1, p2, (0, 255, 0), 2, 1): Draws a rectangle around the tracked face on the frame.

cv2.putText(frame, f'ID: {tracker["id"]}', (p1[0], p1[1] - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2): Writes the ID of the tracked face above the rectangle.

for (x, y, w, h) in faces:: Iterates over each detected face in the faces list.

if not any([tracker for tracker in trackers if ... ]):: Checks if the detected face is not already being tracked.

tracker = cv2.TrackerKCF_create(): Creates a new KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters) tracker.

box = (x, y, w, h): Initializes the bounding box for the tracker with the coordinates of the detected face.

tracker.init(frame, box): Initializes the tracker with the current frame and bounding box.

trackers.append({'tracker': tracker, 'id': face_id, 'box': box}): Adds the new tracker to the trackers list along with its ID and bounding box.

face_id += 1: Increments the face ID counter for the next detected face.

cv2.imshow('Face Detection and Tracking', frame): Displays the frame with face detection and tracking results.

if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):: Checks if the 'q' key is pressed.

break: Exits the loop if the 'q' key is pressed.

cap.release(): Releases the video capture device.

cv2.destroyAllWindows(): Closes all OpenCV windows.
